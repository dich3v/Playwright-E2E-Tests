# Playwright-E2E-Tests

This repository contains end-to-end test automation projects written in JavaScript using **Playwright**.

Each project targets a different web application provided during QA training at **SoftUni**.
The applications under test are not included in this repository and were available only in a training environment.

This code is intended to demonstrate my skills in UI and E2E test automation - not to serve as a fully runnable test suite out of the box.


## What’s Included

Test projects covering real-world E2E scenarios such as:

- User registration, login, and logout
- Role-based UI navigation
- CRUD operations
- Form handling and validations
- Browser dialogs and assertions

Each folder represents a separate Playwright project and includes:

✅ Playwright test specifications  
✅ Playwright configuration files  
✅ Project dependencies (`package.json`)  
✅ Structured test suites using Playwright Test Runner  


## Technologies Used

- Language: JavaScript
- Test Framework: Playwright
- Runtime: Node.js
- Test Type: End-to-End (E2E)
- IDE: VS Code

## About Execution

The tests were created as part of QA automation coursework and personal practice.

- The applications under test are **not public**
- Backend services and databases are **not included**
- Some applications were available only temporarily during training

For this reason, the tests are intended **for code review and demonstration purposes only**, not for direct execution.
